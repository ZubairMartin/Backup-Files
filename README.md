This repo stores the kinematics and impedance control matlab/simulink files. The latest files are on the Speedgoat pc.

## Kinematics file
Use the demo folder to view the forward and inverse kinematics. The values can be used in the simulink file to test it out on the legs.

## Impedance control file
Use the aluminium with the runOnSpeedGoat folders to test all the files. First run the set to zero file and thereafter the 'test.slx' file.
